### Step 6: Redeploy with Database

```

### Step 7: Share Your Chat App
- Copy the deployment URL (like: `https://chat-app-abc123.vercel.app`)
- Send to your friend
- Both visit the same URL and start chatting!

## How to Use Your Deployed Chat App:

### Login Credentials:
- **Alice** → password: `password123`
- **Bob** → password: `password456`
- **You** → password: `temp`
- **Sarah Johnson** → password: `temp`

### Chat Instructions:
1. Both you and your friend visit the URL
2. Log in as different users
3. Select each other from the user list
4. Start real-time messaging!

## Troubleshooting:
- If deployment fails, check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Make sure `DATABASE_URL` is correctly set in environment variables
- The app will work exactly like it does in Replit

Your chat app will be live 24/7 and accessible from anywhere in the world!
